# Deploy Netflix Clone on Cloud using Jenkins - DevSecOps Project!

DevSecOps Pipeline Solution built using Jenkins as the CI tool. With Sonarqube, OWASP, and Trivy for security and vulnerability detection. Docker was used in containerizing the App, while ArgoCD enabled Continuous Deployment to AWS EKS. Helm made managing the Kubernetes applications a breeze. With the power of Prometheus and Grafana, we gained valuable insights into the application’s performance, cluster health, and pipeline metrics.
